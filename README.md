# Lifestyle Determinants of Obesity: A Detailed Analysis Using Synthetic Data

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how demographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors contribute to obesity using a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 2,111 individuals. The analysis leverages interactive visualizations and statistical methods to identify patterns and key obesity predictors. Though conducted a year ago, the final project paper summarizes the full scope of this work, which included Tableau dashboards and Jupyter-based preprocessing.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on demographic and lifestyle factors
- Generate and test hypotheses related to obesity risk
- Build interactive dashboards to visualize data patterns
- Provide insights for targeted public health interventions

## 📁 Project Files

- `Drashti_Mehta_Final_Project_Paper.pdf`: Full project report including methodology, hypothesis testing, Tableau dashboard summaries, and conclusions

## 📦 Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For preprocessing, feature engineering, and statistical exploration  
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)**: For data handling and preprocessing

## 📌 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle  
- Title: [Obesity Levels Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels)  
- Description: Contains demographic, dietary, and activity-related features, as well as a target variable indicating obesity classification

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Gender & Age Impact**: Obesity risk generally declines with age and differs significantly across genders
- **Technology Usage**: Higher screen time correlates with increased obesity risk
- **Physical Activity**: Individuals with higher activity levels show lower BMI and risk scores
- **Genetics**: A family history of obesity is a strong predictor of higher BMI across all age groups

## 📈 Visualizations (Described in Paper)

Although the original Tableau dashboards are not available, the project paper includes detailed design and development rationale for:
- Line charts (e.g., Age vs. Obesity Risk by Gender)
- Box plots (e.g., Technology Usage vs. BMI)
- Scatter plots (e.g., Physical Activity vs. Obesity Score)
- Interactive features like sliders and dropdowns (described in text)

## 🧩 Feature Engineering

- Created composite features such as **Dietary Score**, **Physical Activity Score**, **Hydration Level**, and **Family Obesity History Score**
- Binned age into categories for clearer demographic comparison

## 🎯 Outcome

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering nuanced public health insights. It highlights how tools like Tableau, when combined with statistical analysis, can aid in understanding and addressing global challenges like obesity.
